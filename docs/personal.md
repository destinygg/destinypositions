## College

I attended the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](https://www.unomaha.edu/) and majored in woodwind performance but eventually dropped out due to conflict with work at the time.

In general, I do not think that people need to have a college degree in order to have good opinions or to know what they are talking about. Over the past several years of debate and conversation my respect for college-educated individuals has significantly dropped. That being said, a formal education certainly doesn't hurt. I think laymen should generally defer to the consensus of experts. A good example of this can be found in [my discussion with Vegan Gains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yK-lO98scI).

## My Family

I have a son called Nathaniel with my ex-girlfriend, Rachel. My ex-girlfriend and I broke up a long time ago due to our toxic relationship, but we are on good terms today and get along well with each other. I have an ex-wife as well, but she is not the mother of my child.

## My Relationship

[Melina](https://www.twitch.tv/melina) is my wife. We met in New Zealand when she was 20 years old and I was 30 years old.

Melina and I are currently in an open/poly relationship. We treat each other as primary partners, though we may pursue other sexual/romantic relationships as well.
