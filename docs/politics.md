## Political Discourse in General

In 2016, as Donald Trump was rising as a contender in the Republican primary, I noticed the political discourse was so far removed from reality that people weren't even having conversations in the same universe. My main goal in entering politics was to bring some reasonableness into some of the conversations, or to at least ground the disagreements in fact so the conversations could be more productive. Unfortunately, most of my conversations so far have been horrible and hardly qualify for "intellectual discourse."

I believe most content creators suffer from the following problems:
- They tend to be uninformed about the ideas they are discussing. (e.g.: most lefties don't know the LVT, many online Republicans don't know anything about sociology)
- They don't read any of the material they are covering. (e.g.: many people only read headlines, or just take a Twitter thread and repeat the information from it without reading any of the linked articles or sources)
- They are more concerned with monetary gain and advancing their careers than they are with advancing any ideologies. (e.g. they will [eschew politically effective or more righteous actions](https://streamable.com/d69bog) in favor of things that further their own career, such as collaborating with only the most famous politicians they can or promoting causes which will also grow their own popularity)
- They are often blatantly hypocritical when comparing their lifestyles to the ideas they advocate for. (e.g.: they will oftentimes talk about the importance of transparency in public figures or make fun of celebrities for donating very little money to social causes while they themselves will hide their income and make excuses for it)

My general goal with online politics is to:
- Give an informed opinion about, or bring in experts or expert material concerning, current events and interesting topics.
- Have an informed discussion that involves reading through the articles or sources being discussed on stream.
- Move people to take politically effective action.
- Exemplify my political and ethical values in the way I live my life.

## "Omni-Liberalism"

In politics, it can be useful to know which particular ideology someone subscribes to. However, I do not fall perfectly in-line with any particular ideology. I describe myself as an *Omni-Liberal*, which is a made-up, tongue-in-cheek term to encapsulate the general position of:

1. Having the core values of liberalism (e.g. freedom and equality).
2. Taking the best parts of all different kinds of political ideologies and using them together in a pragmatic way.

I don't feel dogmatically attached to any particular form of government or economic system. If it can be demonstrated that some economic system (socialismwwpitalism, etc...) can consistently produce better economic and social outcomes for a given society, that would be the econome I would advocate for. As of right now, I believe that free markets with strong social safety nets (see: Scandanavia) are the most effective way of achieving these ends.

## Philosophical Axioms and Consistency

I think that political positions should be the result of a consistent system — namely, an underlying ethical and epistemic framework. My personal system starts with the axiom of wanting to maximize my own well-being, and then from there I build out an altruistic mindset to maximize the well-being of others around me. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-eTcjGsK08) is the beginning of an attempt to explain how I try to build my political positions from my more fundamental values.

My applied political positions always follow from my moral system. I think that this is a much better state of affairs than having my political positions be inherited from my parents, or inherited from a particular political party. I think the world would be a better place if people reflected more on their internal, fundamental values and used those as guiding principles to establish their political values, rather than blindly following an ideologue, or using inherited positions from their parents, religion, or country.

A lot of political debate actually just boils down to having some differing, fundamental position. Instead of two people arguing at a surface level about an issue, it is sometimes more useful to dive down to try and figure out what the other person actually believes at a fundamental level. A great example of this is abortion — people will often debate back and forth about the legality of abortion while ignoring that they fundamentally disagree on whether or not a fetus should carry the same (or similar) moral consideration as an infant child.

## Libertarianism

[Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) is concerned with maximizing liberty and personal freedom. I viewed myself as a libertarian when I was a teenager and have read books by [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand).

I am still pro liberty and pro freedom, but my political views have evolved. Libertarianism does not seem to do a very good job at solving some major problems, like social inequality and global warming. The latter, in particular, seems likely only to be solved by international cooperation at a global level.

## The Alt-Right

I do not support the alt-right, nor any of the prescriptions they make for society. I do believe it is important, however, to acknowledge some of the conditions that lead people to becoming radicalized, e.g. feeling disconnected from society, having no sense of purpose, feeling economically left behind. I believe some on the alt-right are effective at identifying frustrations that one might have with our current economic or social system, but they offer no realistic solutions to any of these problems, and their explanations for said phenomenon are often mired in anecdote.

My [debate with Erik Striker & James Allsup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48MhURMh1A) is emblematic of most discourse that I've had with alt-right figures: when confronted with challenges to their ideas, they retreat to anecdotes and offer no solutions. Most concerningly, the policy positions they offer for political change generally require some extreme amount of state-sponsored violence and are highly unrealistic in achieving any positive end.

## Populism

I do not support [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism).

Populism is usually defined as "the people" versus "the elites." This happens on both the right (e.g. the alt-right & Donald Trump) and the left (e.g. Bernie-or-Busters). Populism is powerful because it feeds off negative emotions, but is often not based in facts.

## Capitalism

I consider myself to be a capitalist.

At a high-level, capitalism seems to be the best-known economic system to generate wealth. I believe the responsibility of any economic system should, first and foremost, be to allocate resources in an economy as efficiently as possible in order to create the largest possible base from which to draw taxes from to redistribute to those who need it most. I recognize that in many western countries, especially the USA, we seem to have a big problem with the "redistribution" part.

There are different kinds of capitalism ranging all the way from *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* (e.g. free market) to [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) (e.g. China). Completely free-market systems have serious downsides (e.g. monopolies, unequal bargaining power) and don't properly account for negative externalities (e.g. pollution, global warming) without some government intervention. Thus, I believe that capitalism should be tempered by a strong government that tries to correct for these problems, similar to how Nordic countries function. Not surprisingly, this is the exact state of affairs in nearly all advanced economies in the West.

## Socialism / Communism

### The Academic Arguments

While exploring more socialist ideas I've come across a number of people attempting to defend their ideologies. I've had discussions with many people who identify as [socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism), including [Michael Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Albert) (an economist, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7tfIxcQYPU)), [Ben Burgis](https://twitter.com/BenBurgis) (Jacobin columnist, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaKBp9x3CpE&t=163s)), and many, many more (Search YouTube for "destiny socialism").

My primary disappointment with most socialists is the broader lack of understanding concerning the general functions of their economic systems. A few issues without satisfactory answers are -

- How do we decide which businesses are allowed to exist in a socialist society without allowing capital investment?
- Is any form of investment whatsoever allowed in a socialist society? How do businesses raise additional capital for expansion?
- How are labor markets determined in a socialist society? What if everyone wants to become a teacher?
- How can we accurately calculate which goods/services a society needs if we do away with the commodity form? ie: calculation problem

### Online Socialist Activism

A lot of the discourse around socialism (e.g. on Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter) comes from people who are widely ignorant of economics and how capital markets actually work. A number of prominent, socialist content creators seem to display fundamental misunderstandings of basic fact, such as [Philosophy Tube's video on housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbhZWZf0gM), and they tend to [respond negatively](https://twitter.com/UnlearnEcon/status/1340289575311331328) to even the [slightest bit of push back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vfx1kQlmOk) against them.

While there are plenty of highly intelligent people who identify as socialists, my interactions with "online socialists" or "online lefties" from 2018 to 2020 have generally left me with a very low impression of the community at large.

### Co-ops

Co-ops, or [cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), are businesses owned by the workers. Many socialists, especially market socialists, seem to point towards co-ops as being an effective transition step away from a fully capitalist society, or one where businesses have private ownership.

I don't believe anything is inherently wrong with co-ops, and I support them in the cases where they lead to greater economic productivity. Despite the slight increase in productivity, however, it seems hard to understand how co-ops can effectively raise capital, and I still question whether co-ops would retain their benefits if everyone in society were to join one, rather than just the select few that have the necessary capital and/or skills to join one of the few co-ops that exist today.

### Political Ineffectiveness

A major gripe that I have with "online socialism" is that it is politically impotent.

All policies instituted by the government are going to have pros and cons. Let's debate these policies and try to find out which ones will be the best. Once we know that, we can then put pressure on our local politicians and state representatives to try and implement the ones that are politically feasible.

But most socialists that I talk to have no actual policy positions. They live in a fantasy land where all capital is abolished, without a plan for how to get there and without a plan for solving the actual problems that we are facing right now.

## Social Justice

I think that social justice is a real thing. We have made a ton of progress so far (in e.g. ending slavery, ending redlining, legalizing gay marriage) but we are not at the finish line yet. In general, the government should work to protect the rights of minority groups, including trans people.

Sometimes, social justice can go too far (e.g. [Rachel Dolezal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal) & "transracialism," Twitch banning the "blind playthrough" tag, pronouns based on animals). On the other hand, a lot of people against social justice have ridiculous and overblown concepts of what social justice even is (from e.g. watching "SJW owns" videos on YouTube).

The right place is somewhere in the middle. I advocate that you should try to have respect for other people, especially if doing so won't inconvenience you that much. In general, this means that if someone wants you to call them she/her, then you should probably be polite and do so.

Also see the section on [systemic racism](#systemic-racism).

## Diversity

In general, I believe diversity is a good thing, though there are times when it can be taken too far. It would be a mistake for groups and organizations to strive for a purely equal representation of all genders and races — the best person should get the job, regardless of what gender or race they are.

At the same time, though, there is a big difference between a group of 10 men versus a group of 9 men + 1 women. When hiring the 10th person for this group, if a man and a women have similar credentials, it might benefit the group a lot more to hire the women — the group would gain a different perspective and it would be more well-rounded.

A great anecdote showcasing this concept is the software engineers who developed the first successful facial recognition software. As the story goes, when the engineers were refining their algorithms, they were testing on themselves and people in their local area. It was only later, when the technology got to be used in a more widespread fashion, that they realized it had [problems categorizing black faces](https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/). If the team had had even one black engineer, it might have helped them catch this problem early on, resulting in a better product.

Anecdotes aside, what does the data say? Research tends to show that [diversity does tend to have benefits](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/), but [it isn't completely one-sided](https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail).

Also see the section on [affirmative action](#affirmative-action).

## Affirmative Action

I am neither for nor against affirmative action — it depends on how it is implemented.

For example, I am against [California's "woman quota" for corporate boards](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/14/this-state-requires-company-boards-include-women-new-lawsuit-says-thats-unconstitutional/), because it seems like it is going too far.

Also see the section on [diversity](#diversity).

## Systemic Racism

[Systemic racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism) is racism embedded into a system. The important thing to note about systemic racism is that no-one in the system is necessarily to blame. For example, say that the hypothetical police force of Oceania was systemically racist — it had a computer system programmed to assign more police drive-bys to black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods. In this system, it is possible that **every single police officer** in the force is a black-loving certified anti-racist, yet the police would still be functioning as a racist institution.

We have pretty strong evidence that in the United States, there are some lingering forms of systemic racism. For example, by [looking at graphs of where redlining existed](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/19/498536077/interactive-redlining-map-zooms-in-on-americas-history-of-discrimination), we can see that the effects of redlining still affect outcomes (in a statistical, on-average way).

Just like in Oceania, this doesn't necessarily mean that ordinary people are to blame. Of course, there are probably racist people in the country somewhere still in charge of bank loans or city planning — but, for the most part, I think that we have that sorted out. We need to focus on the more complicated problems.

I think that systemic racism clearly exists (in some forms). I don't have a strong opinion on the best policies to address it.

Also see the section on [reparations](#reparations).

## Reparations

After the civil war, [former slaves were promised 40 acres and a mule](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/the-truth-behind-40-acres-and-a-mule/) by William T. Sherman. This was approved by President Lincoln. Later, the federal government reneged on this promise, which seems pretty unfair.

There are many different reasons for wanting reparations, but I think that the best one is purely for the purposes of (finally) repaying a debt that was promised.

Logistically, implementing reparations would be difficult (Who exactly gets the money? How much money is equivalent to 40 acres, adjusted for inflation?). I acknowledge that reparations are probably not politically feasible.

## Voting

Voting is important.

People in America (and around the world) have problems <strong>right now</strong> that need to be solved. And that's best done by working within the current system, building coalitions with like-minded people, and voting for the best candidates (at both a local and a national level).

## Global Warming

I think that global warming is a real thing and is anthropogenic (caused by humans).

Unfortunately, I have low hopes that the world will be able to agree to reduce carbon emissions to prevent significant warming (<4°C).

I don't support any particular policies relating to global warming, although I would like to see America (and the rest of the world) become carbon neutral as fast as reasonably possible.

## The Green New Deal

I do not support the [Green New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal), a policy championed by the [Justice Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats).

While I support harsh action being taken to curb the effects of climate change, I don't necessarily think it's appropriate to pair these changes with other, non-environmental policies, e.g. a federal jobs guarantee. I think that climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed both through policies that have been demonstrated to work (e.g. [cap and trade](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/?DocumentID=4110#:~:text=Well%2Ddesigned%20cap%2Dand%2D,environmentally%20effective%20and%20cost%2Deffective.&text=Successful%20cap%2Dand%2Dtrade%20systems,violation%20penalties%2C%20and%20high%20compliance.)) and through innovative policies and technologies.

## International Trade Agreements

I am highly in favor of international trade agreements, especially large binding agreements like the now-dead [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership) that Obama championed. This is mostly for two reasons:

1. International cooperation — International trade agreements lay the groundwork for even more international trade agreements. Ever-increasing cooperation is one of the only hopes we have at solving global warming.
2. American soft power — In forfeiting the TPP, America cedes ground to China and their [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative). Soft power is more important than you might think. Without it, we lose the ability to exert pressure on other countries to respect the values of democracy, personal freedom, political freedom, and basic human rights.

## Stock Buybacks

Stock buybacks are sometimes characterized as being greedy, benefitting stockholders over employees, or as choosing to avoid investment into research & development. This is largely a fiction spun by the financially illiterate. [TBC]

Unfortunately, some public figures (e.g. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez)) seem to be ignorant on these points.
