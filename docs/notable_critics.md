## Jack Allison

Jack Allison is an internet podcaster/ex-Jimmy Kimmel writer who is definitely [not mad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmV09SkVjvA) and who is currently banned from using Twitter by his wife [[original](https://twitter.com/JackAMtheShow/status/1359911896690790409) | [backup](https://i.imgur.com/X95350H.png)].

Despite his time-out from social media, Jack still finds time to obsess over what I do both on and off stream. After I took a step back from my canvassing efforts in Omaha, Jack took it upon himself to [email me to celebrate](https://imgur.com/a/OTDFQMS). Unsatisfied with the lack of attention he received for his wacky antics, he [created a fake reddit account](https://i.imgur.com/jy0MXW6.png) to further our interactions by impersonating [a photographer of WOWT](https://www.wowt.com/authors/brandon-tvrdy/), a local media station in Omaha. My web dev, Cake, pulled [some information](https://i.imgur.com/ujsdcBh.png) from our back-end to confirm this dastardly ploy.

Jack - I mean, Brandon, flexes his prior media training and [asks me what appears to be several thoughtful questions](https://i.imgur.com/xTi1KjB.png) regarding my canvassing experiment in Omaha. I [do my best to respond in good faith](https://i.imgur.com/7IlKX3J.png) ([these](https://i.imgur.com/gjyViWk.png) are the linked "off the record" logs), but little did I know...[it was all a ruse](https://i.imgur.com/9MSulwm.png)!

After thoroughly owning me, Jack [takes to Reddit on his account](https://imgur.com/a/4dQX5T0) to expose me for my crimes, though he unfortunately doesn't have the required karma to post on his new account. Since he can't seem to make progress on Reddit, he decides to create a fake Twitter ([backup from the now deleted account](https://i.imgur.com/czHjDdL.png)) to tweet about his fake Reddit account's fake email that he sent to me to a whole bunch of people on Twitter, himself included. Unfortunately for Jack, he [accidentally leaks](https://streamable.com/of232a) on his stream that he's logged in to the very Reddit account he was masquerading under.

Unlucky! And definitely not mad.
