Many things are said about who I am or what I believe in. Many make absurd claims about my politics, claiming that I advocate for the indiscriminate killing of BLM protestors, that I'm a nazi, that I'm a communist, etc...etc...Part of this is somewhat on me as I tend to be quite hyperbolic when I speak, and I tend to engage with people who aren't really interested in good faith conversations. Part of this is also the difficulty in the format; I don't agree that it's fair that I demand someone watch through hundreds of hours of my content in order to figure out what my actual view is on any given topic.

As I've evolved, both in my political and social views, and as I've continued to produce more and more hours of content, it seems possible that you could cherry pick almost any 30 seconds of my content to claim I represent any given political or social viewpoint. In 2021 I committed myself to a strategy of being more rhetorically engaged with how people view me.

This is my effort to "set the record straight" insofar as what I actually believe. I'll include within these pages a record of most of my policy and philosophical positions, as well as any positions I have relating to current events.
