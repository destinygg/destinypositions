## Who I am

My name is Steven Bonnell; my online handle across [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/destiny), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@destinydebates?lang=en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theomniliberal?lang=en) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/destiny/) is Destiny. I'm most well known for my political content online, but I started my career as a [Starcraft 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) livestreamer. Today, I stream most aspects of my life, including gaming, philosophy, politics, online debates, and canvassing for political change. Throughout my life, I have always tried to ensure the consistency of my beliefs, and the best way to test them is allow others to challenge them.

## Origin story

My streaming career began in 2010, well before Twitch was established as the de facto platform for it. Over time, LiveStream.com & uStream.tv gave way to Justin.tv, which eventually became Twitch. This was likely the lowest point of my life; I had dropped out of university to pursue a lucrative career at a casino kitchen, and was subsequently [fired](https://youtu.be/H5GMj0YUM98) for breaking the corporate chain of command to lodge a complaint regarding how disgusting the soda machine consistently was due to lack of cleaning. This culminated in my manager writing me up for frivolous reasons, the final one being trying to save a co-worker's job.

After leaving the casino, I worked as a carpet cleaner. In my downtime between jobs, I started broadcasting myself playing games and having philosophical discussions. Eventually, as Twitch grew in popularity, I became a partner and it became my primary platform.

As Donald Trump began to become relevant politically, I started recognizing that the current state of online political discourse was abysmal. Many popular interlocutors on the left seemed to rely more on moral superiority than effective rhetoric, and Democrats seemed to be incapable of defending their positions. To combat this, I added political debates to my content offerings. Overall, I was mostly focused on arguing about effective policy, but some moral stances ended up being included, such as the [age of consent](https://youtu.be/0uw9NWF7Z6w).

## Twitch ban

I was a streamer on Twitch for 3,943 days, from June 6th, 2011 until March 23rd 2022. That day, I received an [email](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FKyWM3ly.png%26sa%3DD%26source%3Deditors%26ust%3D1676875261704838%26usg%3DAOvVaw0CN9K_6udirHjlRPn8PUCL) notifying me of a permanent suspension for "hateful conduct". Due to being previously [departnered](https://positions.destiny.gg/docs/current_events#kyle-rittenhouse-mowing-down-protestors) over a [debate](https://youtu.be/h_0R_aiPb-s) regarding self-defense in riots. After several appeals, I have yet to obtain more specific information regarding this disciplinary action beyond automated rejections.

I suspect this is likely a reaction to my position that, based on the currently available data, the rules for trans athlete participation in collegiate environments might be unfair to cis women. The gender-affirming benefits conferred from participating in high school/intramural/professional sports seem to significantly outweigh the drawbacks, however, the scholarship opportunities reserved for womens' sports at a university were specifically created to give opportunities to those who lack the advantages accrued by male puberty/endocrinology to be competitive.

My ban might also be related to any number of comments I've made concerning certain individuals, or online activist groups. As the definition of "hateful conduct" seems to vary depending on contemporary discourse and who is being accused, it is impossible for me to draw any definitive conclusions regarding what facet of my content was deemed as hateful.

What I can say for certain is that I wasn't banned for platforming controversial figures such as Nick Fuentes, because that would be classified as ban evasion. It also wasn't related to off-platform content, as the email specified that the conduct occured on stream. Some rumours are still circulating that it was due to hate raiding, harassment, or other forms of brigading, but the email doesn't seem to indicate that either.

## Political advocacy

In [November of 2020](https://youtu.be/93leuGiUSpo), I took my first steps to spin up an organization to mobilize youth into direct, local, offline political action. Our first efforts were for the Senate runoff election in Georgia, where we [knocked on over 20,000](https://www.wrbl.com/news/georgia-news/math-mvmt-hosts-canvassing-event-ahead-of-senate-run-offs/) doors in support of Jon Ossoff and Reverend Warnock. For my next effort, I wanted to focus on my hometown of Omaha, Nebraska to see if we could mobilize enough volunteers to get a progressive candidate elected to office. Unfortunately, because of how people and news organizations [mischaracterized my actions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/lx0dnw/incredibly_disappointed_at_the_lack_of/), I was forced to stop campaigning for my mayor of choice. I've also interviewed [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AoEIeVrbWU) [number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLQUuui7ThA) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9rtW5Vre2s) [individuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag23SLc2fIs) running for state and local offices, including [exposing fraud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0FnS1gFV4o) in other candidates. For the 2022 midterms, I doubled down in my [canvassing efforts](https://youtu.be/AO6yrG1tggc) for Warnock, which went [pretty well](https://i.redd.it/s422cm501r961.png). Moving forward, I am planning to found a media company that focuses on responsible messaging.

## Why I made this page

Many things are said about who I am or what I believe in. Most often, I am accused of having spiteful positions constructed to contrast whatever popular talking points are currently circulating.

My opinions are strictly founded in 2 fundamental principles: internal consistency and empirical data. Ideally, we should all have some sort of internally consistent moral system backed by data to generate policy prescriptions.

By nature of having put the majority of my life on the internet and being open to change my opinion, it has become trivial to gather a collection of 30 second clips to construct a false image of me being racist, transphobic, encouraging violence, etc., while the majority of my available content contraindicates these views.

This is partially my fault. I am obnoxiously abrasive, sometimes far too hyperbolic, annoyingly offensive, and often engage with people who aren't interested in good faith conversations. Part of this is also due to my huge backlog of content and the nature of the internet - I understand that sifting through thousands of hours of debates to find my fully, fleshed-out views is not a realistic ask to make of people unfamiliar with my work.

As such, the following pages are my effort to set the record straight insofar as establishing my current beliefs, as opposed to what others claim them to be.
