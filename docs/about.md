## Who I am

My name is Steven Bonnell and my online handle across [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/destiny), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/destiny) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/destiny/) is Destiny. I'm most well known for my political content online, but I started my career as a [Starcraft 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) livestreamer. Today I livestream most aspects of my life; including gaming, online debates, and canvassing for political change. Throughout my life I have always tried to ensure the consistency of my beliefs, and to test my ideas I would argue with others.

## Political advocacy

Starting in [November of 2020](https://youtu.be/93leuGiUSpo), I attempted to spin up an organization to mobilize youth into direct, local political action. Our first efforts were in Georgia, where we [knocked on over 20,000](https://www.wrbl.com/news/georgia-news/math-mvmt-hosts-canvassing-event-ahead-of-senate-run-offs/) doors in support of Jon Ossoff and Reverend Warnock. For my next effort, I wanted to focus on my hometown of Omaha, Nebraska to see if we could mobilize enough volunteers to get a progressive candidate elected to office. Unfortunately because of how people and news organizations [mischaracterized my actions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/lx0dnw/incredibly_disappointed_at_the_lack_of/), I was forced to stop campaigning for my mayor of choice. I've also interviewed a number of individuals ( [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AoEIeVrbWU) | [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLQUuui7ThA) | [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9rtW5Vre2s) | [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag23SLc2fIs) ) running for state and local offices while [exposing fraud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0FnS1gFV4o) in other candidates.

## Why I made this website/blog

Many things are said about who I am or what I believe in. Oftentimes, people make absurd claims about my beliefs, such as that I advocate for the indiscriminate killing of BLM protestors, that I'm a nazi, that I'm a communist, etc. This is partially my fault as I have a history of being hyperbolic in some circumstances, and I often engage with people who aren't really interested in good faith conversations. Part of this is also due to my huge backlog of content and the nature of the internet - I understand that sifting through thousands of hours of debates to find my fully fleshed-out views is not a practical demand to make of people.

As I've evolved both in my political and social views, and as I've continued to produce more hours of content, it is now possible that you could cherry pick almost any 30 seconds of me to claim I represent any given political or social viewpoint. As such, it is necessary to take preventative measures against this, as I have dealt with such behaviour already. In 2021, I committed myself to a strategy of being more rhetorically effective, especially concerning how people represent me or my beliefs.

As a part of this strategy, the following pages are my effort to "set the record straight" insofar as my actual beliefs, as opposed to what others claim them to be. I'll include within these pages a record of most of my political and philosophical positions, as well as any positions I have relating to current events.
