# positions.destiny.gg

This is the GitHub repository for the [Destiny Positions website](https://positions.destiny.gg).

It is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Running the spellchecker

You can run the spellcheck locally using the following command:
```console
yarn run spell-check
```

This will generate a summary report of the words that are not recognized and that should either be fixed or added to the file `.cspell.json`
